Chef has a square-shaped chart paper with the side length equal to NN. He wants to cut out KxK squares from this chart paper.

Find the maximum number of KxK squares he can cut from the entire chart paper.

Note that, some part of the chart paper might not be a included in any K×K cutout square.

Input Format
The first line contains a single integer T — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and K — the side length of the entire chart 
paper and the side length of the cutout squares.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the maximum number of K×K squares Chef can cut from the entire chart paper.

Constraints
1<=T<=1000
1≤K≤N≤1000
Sample 1:
Input

Explanation:
Test case 1: Chef can cut out 25 squares of size 1×1 from the entire 5×5 chart paper.

Test case 2: Chef can cut out 1 square of size 2×2 from the entire 2×2 chart paper.

Test case 3: Chef can cut out 4 squares of size 2×2 from the entire 5×5 chart paper.
