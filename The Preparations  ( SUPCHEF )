Chef has an exam which will start exactly M minutes from now. However, instead of preparing for his exam, Chef started watching Season-1 of Superchef. Season-1
has N episodes, and the duration of each episode is K minutes.

Will Chef be able to finish watching Season-1 strictly before the exam starts?

Note: Please read the explanations of the sample test cases carefully.

Input Format
The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. T test cases then follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains 3 space separated integers M, N and K.
Output Format
For each test case, output on one line YES if it is possible to finish Season-1 strictly before the exam starts, or NO if it is not possible to do so.

Output is case insensitive, which means that "yes", "Yes", "YEs", "no", "nO" - all such strings will be acceptable.

Constraints
1≤T≤10^4 
1≤M≤10^9 
1≤N,K≤10^4
 
Sample 1:
Input
3
10 1 10
25 2 10
15 2 10

Output
NO
YES
NO

Explanation:
Test Case 1: The duration of the only episode is 10 minutes, and the exam starts exactly after 10 minutes. So, Chef will not be able to finish watching Season-1
strictly before the exam starts.

Test Case 2: There are two episodes in Season-1, each of duration 10 minutes. Therefore, Chef will require 10 + 10 = 20 minutes to finish watching Season-1.
As the exam starts after 25 minutes, Chef will be able to finish watching Season-1 strictly before the exam starts.

Test Case 3: There are two episodes in Season-1, each of duration 10 minutes. Therefore, Chef will require 10 + 10 = 20 minutes to finish watchin Season-1.
As the exam starts after 15 minutes, Chef will not be able to finish watching Season-1 strictly before the exam starts.
