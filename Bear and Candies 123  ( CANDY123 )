Bears love candies and games involving eating them. Limak and Bob play the following game. Limak eats 1 candy, then Bob eats 2 candies, then Limak eats 3 candies,
then Bob eats 4 candies, and so on. Once someone can't eat what he is supposed to eat, he loses.

Limak can eat at most A candies in total (otherwise he would become sick), while Bob can eat at most B candies in total. Who will win the game? Print "Limak" 
or "Bob" accordingly.

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers A and B denoting the maximum possible number of candies Limak can eat and the maximum possible number of
candies Bob can eat respectively.

Output
For each test case, output a single line containing one string — the name of the winner ("Limak" or "Bob" without the quotes).

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
1 ≤ A, B ≤ 1000

Explanation:
Test case 1. We have A = 3 and B = 2. Limak eats 1 candy first, and then Bob eats 2 candies. Then Limak is supposed to eat 3 candies but that would mean 1 + 3 = 4 
candies in total. It's impossible because he can eat at most A candies, so he loses. Bob wins, and so we print "Bob".

Test case 2. Now we have A = 4 and B = 2. Limak eats 1 candy first, and then Bob eats 2 candies, then Limak eats 3 candies (he has 1 + 3 = 4 candies in total, which 
is allowed because it doesn't exceed A). Now Bob should eat 4 candies but he can't eat even a single one (he already ate 2 candies). Bob loses and Limak is the winner.

Test case 8. We have A = 9 and B = 12. The game looks as follows:

Limak eats 1 candy.
Bob eats 2 candies.
Limak eats 3 candies (4 in total).
Bob eats 4 candies (6 in total).
Limak eats 5 candies (9 in total).
Bob eats 6 candies (12 in total).
Limak is supposed to eat 7 candies but he can't — that would exceed A. Bob wins.
