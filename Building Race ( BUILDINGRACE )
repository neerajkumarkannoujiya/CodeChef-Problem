Two friends Chef and Chefina are currently on floors A and B respectively. They hear an announcement that prizes are being distributed 
on the ground floor and so decide to reach the ground floor as soon as possible.

Chef can climb down X floors per minute while Chefina can climb down Y floors per minute. Determine who will reach the ground floor first.
In case both reach the ground floor together, print Both.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains four space-separated integers A, B, X, and Y — the current floor of Chef, the current floor of Chefina,
speed of Chef and speed of Chefina in floors per minute respectively.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line:

Chef if Chef reaches the ground floor first.
Chefina if she reaches the ground floor first.
Both if both reach the ground floor at the same time.
You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase. For example, the strings CHEF, chef, Chef, and chEF are all considered the same.

Constraints
1<=T<=2500
1<=A,B<=100

Explanation:
Test case 1: Chef is on the second floor and has a speed of 2 floors per minute. Thus, Chef takes 1 minute to reach the ground floor.
Chefina is on the second floor and and has a speed of 2 floors per minute. Thus, Chefina takes 1 minute to reach the ground floor.
Both Chef and Chefina reach the ground floor at the same time.

Test case 2: Chef is on the fourth floor and has a speed of 1 floor per minute. Thus, Chef takes 4 minute to reach the ground floor.
Chefina is on the second floor and and has a speed of 5 floors per minute. Thus, Chefina takes 0.4 minutes to reach the ground floor.
Chefina reaches the ground floor first.

Test case 3: Chef is on the third floor and has a speed of 4 floors per minute. Thus, Chef takes 0.75 minutes to reach the ground floor.
Chefina is on the second floor and and has a speed of 1 floor per minute. Thus, Chefina takes 2 minutes to reach the ground floor.
Chef reaches the ground floor first.

Test case 4: Chef is on the third floor and has a speed of 2 floors per minute. Thus, Chef takes 1.5 minutes to reach the ground floor.
Chefina is on the second floor and and has a speed of 1 floor per minute. Thus, Chefina takes 2 minutes to reach the ground floor.
Chef reaches the ground floor first.
