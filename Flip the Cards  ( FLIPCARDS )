There are NN cards on a table, out of which XX cards are face-up and the remaining are face-down.

In one operation, we can do the following:

Select any one card and flip it (i.e. if it was initially face-up, after the operation, it will be face-down and vice versa)
What is the minimum number of operations we must perform so that all the cards face in the same direction (i.e. either all are
face-up or all are face-down)?

Input Format
The first line contains a single integer TT — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and XX — the total number of cards and the number
of cards which are initially face-up.
Output Format
For each test case, output the minimum number of cards you must flip so that all the cards face in the same direction.

Constraints
1 \leq T \leq 50001≤T≤5000
2 \leq N \leq 1002≤N≤100
0 \leq X \leq N0≤X≤N

Explanation:
Test Case 1: All the cards are already facing down. Therefore we do not need to perform any operations.

Test Case 2: 22 cards are facing up and 22 cards are facing down. Therefore we can flip the 22 cards which are initially facing down.

Test Case 3: All the cards are already facing up. Therefore we do not need to perform any operations.

Test Case 4: 22 cards are facing up and 88 cards are facing down. Therefore we can flip the 22 cards which are initially facing up.
