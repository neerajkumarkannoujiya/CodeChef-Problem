Chef has the binary representation S of a number XX with him. He can modify the number by applying the following operation exactly once:

Make X X:=X ⊕ ⌊ X/2^Y⌋ , where (1<=Y<= |S|) and ⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.
Chef wants to maximize the value of XX after performing the operation. Help Chef in determining the value of Y which will maximize the value of X
after the operation.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two lines of inputs - the first containing the length of binary string S.
The second line of input contains the binary string SS.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, the value of YY which will maximize the value of X after the operation.

Constraints
1<=T<=5⋅10^4 
1<=|S|<=10^5 
The sum of |S| over all test cases won't exceed 5⋅10^5.
S contains the characters 0 and 1 only.

Explanation:
Test case 1: Since S=10 is the binary representation of 2, the current value of X=2. On choosing Y=1, XX becomes 2 ⊕ ⌊ 3/2^2 ⌋ = 3. 
We can show that this is the maximum value of X we can achieve after one operation.

Test case 2: Since S=11 is the binary representation of 3, the current value of X=3. On choosing Y=2, X becomes 3 ⊕ ⌊ 3/2^2  ⌋ = 3.
We can show that this is the maximum value of X we can achieve after one operation.

Test case 3: Since S=101 is the binary representation of 5, the current value of X=5. On choosing Y=1, XX becomes 5 ⊕ ⌊ 2/2^5 ⌋ = 7.
We can show that this is the maximum value of X we can achieve after one operation.

Test case 4: Since S=110 is the binary representation of 6, the current value of X=6. On choosing Y=2, XX becomes 6 ⊕ ⌊  2/2^6 ⌋ = 7.
We can show that this is the maximum value of X we can achieve after one operation.
