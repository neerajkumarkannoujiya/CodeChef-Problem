Each pizza consists of 4 slices. There are N friends and each friend needs exactly X slices.

Find the minimum number of pizzas they should order to satisfy their appetite.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two integers NN and X, the number of friends and the number of slices each friend wants respectively.
Output Format
For each test case, output the minimum number of pizzas required.

Constraints
1≤T≤100
1≤N,X≤10
Sample 1:
Input
4
1 5
2 6
4 3
3 5

Output
2
3
3
4
Explanation:
Test case 1: There is only 1 friend who requires 5 slices. If he orders 1 pizza, he will get only 4 slices. Thus, at least 2 pizzas should be ordered 
to have required number of slices.

Test case 2: There are 2 friends who require 6 slices each. Thus, total 12 slices are required. To get 12 slices, they should order 3 pizzas.

Test case 3: There are 4 friends who require 3 slices each. Thus, total 12 slices are required. To get 12 slices, they should order 3 pizzas.

Test case 4: There are 3 friends who require 5 slices each. Thus, total 15 slices are required. To get 15 slices, they should order at least 4 pizzas.
