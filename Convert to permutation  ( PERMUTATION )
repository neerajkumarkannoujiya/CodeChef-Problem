You are given an array A of size N. In one operation, you can:

Choose an index i (1≤i≤N) and increase Ai  by 1.
Find the minimum number of operations required to convert the array A into a permutation of size N. If it is impossible to do so, print -1.

Note that a permutation of size NN contains each element from 1 to N exactly once.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains the integer N — the size of the array.
The next line contains N space-separated integers, the elements of the array A.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, the minimum number of operations required to convert the array A into a permutation of size N.
If it is impossible to do so, print −1.

Constraints
1≤T≤500
1≤N≤1000
0≤Ai≤1000

Explanation:
Test case 1: We can convert the array A into a permutation using 3 operations:

Operation 1: Choose i = 3 and increase Ai by 1. Thus, the array becomes A = [3, 1, 2, 2].
Operation 2: Choose i = 3 and increase Ai by 1. Thus, the array becomes A = [3, 1, 3, 2].
Operation 3: Choose i = 3 and increase Ai by 1. Thus, the array becomes A = [3, 1, 4, 2].
It can be shown that this is the minimum number of operations required to convert A into a permutation.

Test case 2: The given array cannot be converted into a permutation using any number of operations.

Test case 3: The given array is already a permutation. Thus, we require 0 operations.

Test case 4: We can convert the array A into a permutation using 3 operations:

Operation 1: Choose i = 1 and increase Ai by 1. Thus, the array becomes A = [3, 0, 1].
Operation 2: Choose i = 2 and increase Ai by 1. Thus, the array becomes A = [3, 1, 1].
Operation 3: Choose i = 3 and increase Ai by 1. Thus, the array becomes A = [3, 1, 2].
It can be shown that this is the minimum number of operations required to convert A into a permutation.
