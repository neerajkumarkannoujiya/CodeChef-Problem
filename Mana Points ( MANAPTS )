Chef is playing a mobile game. In the game, Chef's character Chefario can perform special attacks. However, one special attack costs 
X mana points to Chefario.

If Chefario currently has 
Y mana points, determine the maximum number of special attacks he can perform.

Input Format
The first line contains a single integer 
T — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers 
X and Y — the cost of one special attack and the number of mana points Chefario has initially.
Output Format
For each test case, output the maximum number of special attacks Chefario can perform.

Constraints
1≤T≤10^5
1≤X≤100
1≤Y≤1000
Sample 1:
Input
3
10 30
6 41
50 2

Output
3
6
0
Explanation:
Test case 1: Chefario can perform a maximum of 3 special attacks which will cost him 30 mana points.

Test case 2: Chefario can perform a maximum of 6 special attacks which will cost him 36 mana points. Note that Chefario can not perform 7 special attacks as these
will cost him 42 mana points while he has only 41 mana points.

Test case 3: Chefario will not be able to perform any special attacks in this case.
